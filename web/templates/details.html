		<h4>
			<p>How the idea was born?</p>
		</h4>
		During our Bachelor's degree in "Azrieli, College of Engineering Jerusalem", at Software Engineering,
		We used a lot of different links. Every time we sent a link to a friend or group of students,
		we use the Email or other similar channels.
		<br>Over time, we were looking for an easy and convenient way to share links, and succeed to manage the links so we can retrieve them whenever we needed: 
		<br>therefore we create <b>ShareLink</b>.
		<div class="clr"> </div>
		<br>
		<h4>
			<p>What the site offers?</p>
		</h4>
		<h5>
			<p>User not registered:</p>
		</h5>
		<p>A non signed in user can send a link on the <b>'Main-Page'</b> without any registration to any valid email address.</p>
		<h5>
			<p>Registered User:</p>
		</h5>
		<b>My Saved Links page</b> - user can save all the links are important to him.
		<br><b>New links page</b> - user can see links received from other users.
		<br>If the user wants he can:
		<br>share the link in the group, move the link to the personal page or delete link.
		<br><b>Contacts</b> - user can add a contact to his own personal page, and share links.
		<br>If the user wants he can delete a contact.
		<br><b>Groups</b> - User can create a group and share links there.
		<br>A user can be member of several groups.
		<br>If a user has created a group wants to delete her, he can.
